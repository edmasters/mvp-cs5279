The purpose of this project is to create an online calculator that will allow people to calculate the total value of their employment contract. The goal is to help people understand the true value of their offer since many details like RSU's, healthcare costs, commute, cost of living, etc can greatly effect the value and cause it to diverge largely from the base amount. Additionally, the site endeavors to help fight pay discrimination by informing users of the total compensation percentile of their offer by role (by role and company if possible).


The website is optimized for mobile web since the majority of users access websites using their mobile phones.
