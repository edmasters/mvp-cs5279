The purpose of this project is to create an online calculator that will allow people to calculate the total value of their employment contract. The goal is to help people understand the true value of their offer since many details like RSU's, healthcare costs, commute, cost of living, etc can greatly effect the value and cause it to diverge largely from the base amount. Additionally, the site endeavors to help fight pay discrimination by informing users of the total compensation percentile of their offer by role.


The website is optimized for mobile web since the majority of users access websites using their mobile phones.

This project was built using the MERN stack. The terminal window shows the MongoDB backend is up and running (and connected to the website) even though its functionality isn't visible at this time. The eventual goal of having the mongo backend is to save a user's job title and comp information anonomously and provide a comparison with other similar roles. 

The other functionality is visible in the demo.


### Areas of Extension

The additional feature set has been paused and will not be built out by the time this class ends since I have started a new role that is regretably consuming a great deal of my time. 

1. Finalize comparison UI
2.  Pdf parsing
3. Integrate stock api for company stock
4. Cost of living
5. Commute time
